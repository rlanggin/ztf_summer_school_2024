## Welcome to Day 2!

Today, we'll be working in Google Colab to take advantage of the GPUs that they have available. 
There are two steps you'll need to do to get the notebook and the datasets.

1. Follow [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XD9z8N_CLVuWIpB0aLRQ8OHdyYC49cil/view?usp=sharing) to the dataset zip file.
Then, make a shortcut to this file in your own Google Drive by clicking the "Add shortcut to Drive" button (shown below) and placing it
wherever is convenient (just keep track of where you put it).

2. Follow [this link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ULQ-Q6MVYWEvxq1AyKtw3RZs7hb0UTLd?usp=sharing) to the notebook.
At the top, there are instructions for making a copy of the notebook and connecting the dataset to the Colab runtime.
(If you happen to be looking at these instructions ahead of time, please don't follow them until Tuesday morning,
as I'll likely be making changes until the last minute)

That's it! Everything else will happen in the notebook.
