In this tutorial, we will use AI models to detect objects in sky survey images. There are two notebooks, 

- [vgg16.ipynb](https://github.com/xiaolng/ztf_summer_school_2024/blob/main/lectures/04-le/vgg16.ipynb)
We will train vgg16 model as a binary classifier and explore how the model makes predictions by analyzing the feature maps.

- [faster_rcnn.ipynb](https://github.com/xiaolng/ztf_summer_school_2024/blob/main/lectures/04-le/faster_rcnn.ipynb)
We will apply region based object detection model, FasterRCNN, to detect object in sky survey images.
